\begin{doc}[algebraic_geometry.Spec]
    Takes a commutative ring and outputs its spectrum, a scheme.

# Problem is that this requires TWO code places. Difficult to keep in sync
# - Although the compiler can of course check if the definitions exist in the canard files.
# - Also can scan for definitions which do not yet have documentation.

- to reduce long names, could add \open{namespace} & \close{namespace}
